I love Puppet, but I'm not so into Ruby, and I want to be able to customize
things using my preferred language. Also, right now I often work without a
Puppetmaster server, using fabric to connect to the remote host and run
Puppet manifests. It seems silly to have to bring up another fairly heavy
interpreter on every host when I've got a perfectly good one client-side.
